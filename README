The compiler is invoked like this:
    java -jar govmc.jar $INPUT $OUTPUT

For a short language description, do
    man ./govmc.1

If invoked without arguments, the compiler is started up as a network
service and can then subsequently be used over the net by doing:
    python cwrapper.py $INPUT $OUTPUT $HOST

Check the pygovm/ subdirectory for the government vm, which interprets
the generated bytecode.

Why the government compiler? Because it is the reference
implementation of the government bytecode, to be run on the government
vm (govm). Why? Because it was originally written for CIPHER 5, and
CIPHER 5's theme was "corrupt government". And a corrupt government
needs its own vm.

Ah yes, the whole thing was inspired by the "svm gdi3-praktikumsaufgabe" by
Sascha Mueller of TU Darmstadt.
